## CAS Change Log with an emphasis on Resources

Friends,

We are delighted that new community site is now up and running and there is a lot of activity already! Particularly pleasing is the new resources section which is being added to on a daily basis!

The new site replaces the Google Group discussion forum and CAS wiki. It offers similar functionality but a whole lot more as well and we are looking to add in new features as required by the CAS members. There is a forum dedicated to “Site Issues”, please use this to post your ideas to help us improve the site. We will soon be posting a public list of such desired features.

At the moment the new site provides:

Resources - this is the bit that we did not have before. Anyone can upload a resource which can be anything such as a lesson plan, scheme of work, list or URLs, collection of videos etc.. All resources are owned by the community so anyone can add, edit or improve it with a history of such changes kept. The popularity of all resources is automatically tracked. They can be linked to other resources on the site and can be categorised. It is a very powerful, community-driven, suite of functions.
