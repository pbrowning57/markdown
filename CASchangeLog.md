Friends,

We are delighted that new community site is now up and running and there is a lot of activity already! Particularly pleasing is the new resources section which is being added to on a daily basis!

The new site replaces the Google Group discussion forum and CAS wiki. It offers similar functionality but a whole lot more as well and we are looking to add in new features as required by the CAS members. There is a forum dedicated to “Site Issues”, please use this to post your ideas to help us improve the site. We will soon be posting a public list of such desired features.

At the moment the new site provides:

Resources - this is the bit that we did not have before. Anyone can upload a resource which can be anything such as a lesson plan, scheme of work, list or URLs, collection of videos etc.. All resources are owned by the community so anyone can add, edit or improve it with a history of such changes kept. The popularity of all resources is automatically tracked. They can be linked to other resources on the site and can be categorised. It is a very powerful, community-driven, suite of functions.

A bonus update for the weekend: you can now “like” resources. On each resource page there’s a like button in the feedback section where you can indicate that you like a particular resource. I’m sure you’re probably familiar with the mechanism from Facebook and similar. It has a few advantages:

It helps show the resource creators and editors that you liked it (though a written comment is still better, if you have more to say).

You can now narrow down the list of resources to just the ones that you liked, so it helps you to keep track of your favourite resources.

It also gives a more explicit measure of popularity of a resource, which is factored into the popularity ranking.
